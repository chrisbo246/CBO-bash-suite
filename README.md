# bashpanic

Run common bash functions from a menu.

Most of this scripts are under development, so use them **only for inspirational purpose!** I use them on **Debian** so no tests had been done on other distributions.

## Requirements

**bashpanic_helpers.sh** is required by every other scripts so download it first and put it in **/usr/local/bin**.

**bashpanic_completion** is only useful to have completion when using scripts as command line. Just check the path at the top of the file, run clickpanic_helpers.sh to install completion then logout/in. 

**bashpanic_menu.sh** is a global menu for all script (in development, don't use it).

## Plugins

Other scripts can be run separately. Download the one you need and put it beside **bashpanic_helpers.sh**.

## Usage

Options:
**-m|--menu** Run with a select menu.
**-h|--help** Know more about available functions.
